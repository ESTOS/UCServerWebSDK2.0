    <h3>EnumLineFeatures </h3>
    <p>Bitfield describing which features/function can be executed on a line
</p>
    <p><p>Some of these bit flags indicate that certain functions may be called on the line. For example, if eCTILINEFEATUREMAKECALL is set, the client may call &quot;MakeCall&quot;.<br>
Other bits are indicators of a status, like eCTILINEFEATUREINVALIDPASSWORD, for example, tells the client, that the line will not work as expected, because the password validation on the PBX failed.</p>
</p>
    <div class="typevalues">
      <p>EnumLineFeatures is an Enumeration</p>
