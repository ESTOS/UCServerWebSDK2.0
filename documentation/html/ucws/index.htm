    <h2>UCServer WebService Overview</h2>
    <p>The UCServer WebService is an integral component of the estos UCServer. It can be reached via the following methods:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>http</strong><br />
			The default listen port for http is 7224. You can open the UCWS Web page on http://localhost:7224/ .
		</li>
		<li><strong>https</strong><br />
			The default listen port for https is 7225. You can open the UCWS Web page on https://localhost:7225/ .
			The SSL certificate is self signed by default. It is recommended to configure a real trusted ssl certificate.
		</li>
	</ul>
    <p class="strong">WebService API</p>
    <p>The WebService offers an JSON API for talking with the estos UCServer.</p>
    <p class="strong">Calling conventions</p>
    <p>All API endpoints may be called with GET or POST.</p>
    <p class="strong">Available routes</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="wsdirect.htm">/ws/direct</a></strong><br/>
        Using this route, all functions are called with authentication. No user session is created. This route can be used only for simple methods that do not require events.
        Calling functions in this route has a significant overhead, because the user must be authenticated for every function call. (http://servername:7224/ws/direct/) 
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="wsclient.htm">/ws/client</a></strong><br/>
        This is the default route for clients.
        In this route it is always required to create a user session.
        To create a user session authentication is required.
        The user session authenticates the further function calls. 
        The user session also contains an event channel to receive events from the server. (http://servername:7224/ws/client/)
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="wspublic.htm">/ws/public</a></strong><br/>
        This is the default route for anonymous (public) clients. The functions in this route do not require authentication.
        This route is used to display public available presence. (http://servername:7224/ws/public/) 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All API endpoints may be called with GET or POST. Jsonp is supported.</p>
