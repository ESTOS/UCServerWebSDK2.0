    <h1>ClientCapabilities</h1>
    <p>Data structures and methods to transport and notify client capabilities between clients and the server
</p>
    <p><p>Each client has certain capabilities he is able to handle. They are used to tell other clients the kind of interactions each client is able to process.<br>
If a client wants to start an audio call to another client both clients have to be able to process audio (speakers and microphone present).<br>
As soon as a client is capable to handle audio it tells the server and thus other clients that the client is now ready to process audio requests.<br>
Beside well known capabilities clients may exchange customs capabilities. (e.g. client is capable for some sort of sharing and the appropriate sharing resource id)</p>
