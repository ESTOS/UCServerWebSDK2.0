    <h1>ClientContactsList</h1>
    <p>Client content interface (Favorite/Monitor contacts) aka &quot;ClientContent&quot;
</p>
    <p><p class='strong'>Module description</p>
<p>This module describes the interface for the client content, which are the contacts in the &quot;Favorites&quot; tab in the main window and the contacts in the contact monitor.</p>
<p class='strong'>Client content data model</p>
<p>The client content consists of contact data (the data shown to the user, mainly AsnNetDatabaseContact objects) and the arragment of the contacts in the favorites/monitor, the data structure.</p>
<p>The data is devided in a list of contacts and a tree structure of groupclusters, groups and items.<br /><br>
The root is the &quot;contentstruture&quot; which contains a list of groupclusters (AsnClientContentGroupCluster).<br /><br>
Each groupcluster contains groups (AsnClientContentGroup) and each group contains items (AsnClientContentItem).<br /><br>
Finally the item contains the reference to the contact data in the contactlist.</p>

<p class='strong'>How to use the API</p>
<p>This API is highly flexible - it can be used to get client content with contact data and/or content structure and with/without eventing for updates.<br>
<br /></p>
<p class='strong'>Synchronoously without any events:</p>
<p>Example for a new client, getting all the content (incl. photos) for the first time without any eventing. It is using asnGetClientContent, which is always sending<br>
back all the contacts und structure. Onyl the pictures can be left out to save bandwidth.<br /></p>

<p class='strong'>Asynchronously and with eventing:</p>
<p>Example for a client, getting all the content and subscribe for events using asnSubscribeClientContent.<br /><br>
This Call subscribes to all Events and is asynchronous. The client content will be sent from the server by the change event asnClientContentChanged.<br>
The event will then always occure if there are changes to the client content data or structure. What has changed is described in asnClientContentChanged.</p>

<p class='strong'>Subscibe for events with differential update:</p>
<p>If a client has already a cached version of the client content, it can request a differential update from the server by sending his last known revision.<br>
The resulting event contains only the changed entries (see AsnClientContentChangedArgument for Details) and the client has to update its state/cache accordingly.<br /></p>

<br />
The synchronous and asynchronous can be used together, e.g. if it makes sense to fetch the complete content at first and then subscribe to the events later on.<br />
<p class='strong'>Remarks:</p>
<p>&quot;Changecounter&quot; or &quot;Revision&quot; of the client content, a 64 Bit Integer.</p>
<ul>
<li>For historical reasons the same data ist stored sometimes in strings &quot;u8sContentRevision&quot; or &quot;u8sRevision&quot; and mostly as a 64 bit integer in &quot;iRevision&quot;.<br>
It is the same value, just transported with a different representation.</li>
<li>The revision is a timestamp and will be defined by the server; the client cannot alter this value on the server directly, only by changing parts of the client content.</li>
<li>A new revision from the server is alwyays higher than an old one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the iEventFlagsToSubscribe parameter to</p>
<ul>
<li>eCONTACTS will only result in contact data events</li>
<li>eSTRUCTURE will only result in structure events</li>
<li>eJPEGPHOTO will include the jpeg photos directly in the events; if not set, the contact data will only contain hash values kor the pictures and the client gan request the pictures via asnRequestContactImage if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class='strong'>Details on GroupCluster- and Group-IDs</p>
<ul>
<li>GroupCluster IDs</li>
<li>The GroupCluster ID is a normal number, starting with '100' and counting up.</li>
<li>Reserved numbers are between 0-199:</li>
<li>&quot;0&quot; to &quot;99&quot; -&gt; Reserved</li>
<li>&quot;100&quot; -&gt; The favorites tab in the Windows client main window.</li>
<li>&quot;101&quot; -&gt; First group cluster of the Windoes client which will be shown in the monitor window.</li>
<li>&quot;150&quot; to &quot;199&quot; -&gt; Reserved for possible adminstrative purposes.</li>
<li>&quot;200&quot; -&gt; First group the user can define by himself, so make sure new groupclusters has an id greater or euqals than that.</li>
<li>Group IDs</li>
<li>A Group ID is formatted like this &quot;g:G[number]&quot;, but with the exception of the following reserved IDs they can be any unique string inside a group cluster.<br>
It is recommended to follow the naming convention and make the IDs unique over the whole structure.</li>
<li>Following the standard formatting of the Group ids, new ones should start at &quot;g:G800&quot; and upwards.</li>
<li>GroupID &quot;g:G770&quot; - &quot;g:G778&quot;: reserved for special groups.</li>
<li>&quot;g:G770&quot; - Group with additional phone line items of the user; only visisble in the windows client if enabled in the client settings.</li>
<li>&quot;g:G771&quot; - Group for the administrative &quot;Jeder sieht jeden im Monitor&quot; setting in the windows client monitor window.</li>
<li>&quot;g:G772&quot; - Reserved.</li>
<li>GroupID &quot;g:G779&quot; is the first freely usable group ID inside a group cluster.<br>
For historical reasons the Windows client is always starting with &quot;g:G779&quot; in every group cluster, which is possible, but makes it a bit harder to distinct between the groups over the whole structure.</li>
</ul>
<p class='strong'>Client Content Tagging</p>
<p>A client can &quot;tag&quot; contacts if changes on these contacts (presence, data etc.) are of special interest for the user.<br>
Technically the &quot;tags&quot; are just the contact IDs in a list. The API provided here makes it possible to change the list on the UCServer and get events, if another client of the same user makes changes to the list.<br>
In the Windows client it is used to inform the user of specific presence state changes of the contacts the user tagged in the UI (e.g. available again, has a call to pickup etc.).</p>
