    <h3>asnSetDynamicRights</h3>
    <p>Operation to set access rights for another contact on contact data and contcat service information.
</p>
    <p><p>This operation is used to grant access rights (or changing them) to other users (contacts) on contact informations and service states of this contact.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The access rights in the ucserver are always a sum of the global, group and personal right lists and what they grant. So removing specific rights with this<br>
operation has no effect if the same rights are granted through global or group rights.</p>
<p>If the operation was executed successfully the result <a href="PresenceV2.type.AsnSetDynamicRightsResult.html">AsnSetDynamicRightsResult</a> is returned.</p>
<p>If an error occured, AsnRequestError is returned.</p>
<p><strong>The access rights list</strong><br /><br>
If a client wants to receive contact data, its logged in contact (= user) has to have access rights granted by the other user to him.<br>
Each user of the ucserver has a list of access rights she gives other users. If someone is in this list, he can see contact data<br>
and/or service states of the user depending on the rights level granted.</p>
<p>The list can be modified by <a href="PresenceV2.asnSetDynamicRights.html">asnSetDynamicRights</a> and <a href="PresenceV2.asnRemoveDynamicRights.html">asnRemoveDynamicRights</a></p>
<p><strong>Contact rights challenge</strong><br /><br>
In conjunction with the access rights list is the mechanic of the &quot;contact rights challenge&quot;.<br /><br>
To get on the access list of another user, the user must request such rights from him or will get them through administrative configuration.<br>
If there is no administrative configuration the other user will be &quot;challenged&quot; to grant or deny rights to the user.<br>
This process is started as soon as a user (challenger) requests the ucserver by calling asnGetAndSubscribePresence on another users ContactID (challengee).<br>
The ucserver checks if there are already given rights and if not, the challenged user gets a new entry in his challenge request list, which then will be<br>
dispatched to all of his clients. These clients should now prompt the user to accept or deny the request and the result will be saved in his access rights list.<br>
On the other side, the challenger will get data and service status after some time or not. There is no extra notification if the challenge was answered or not.</p>
