    <h1>BinaryTransfer</h1>
    <p>Data structures and methods to transport binary data between clients and the server
</p>
    <p><p>The binary transfer can be used to transport any binary data blob between clients. ItÂ´s primary targeting to transfer<br>
files within the chat but may be used to implement file sharing in remote desktop sessions as well as to implement a new procall function:<br>
Provinding files for customers.<br>
The interface is simple and has no other dependencies.<br>
Primary target is to be able to transport the file contents inband in the asn.1 connection.<br>
Later the implementation will also target 3rd party file shares like onedrive, awss3, dropbox or ucweb.</p>
